# Removes a third-party service (Twitter, Facebook...) account that belongs to the
# current user. Takes the name of the service (`service`) and the user ID (`uid`) on
# that service to delete.

# If this is the user's only service account and they don't have a SuccessWhale account,
# this is equivalent to deleting all information about them. If the user has other
# service accounts or has set up a SuccessWhale account, their other accounts will be
# unaffected.

# This is POST /deleteaccount not DELETE /account due to restriction of HTTP verbs that
# can be used in CORS requests by web clients.
