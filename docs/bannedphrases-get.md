Get Banned Phrases
------------------

Returns the list of banned phrases (`bannedphrases`) that the current user has set up in SuccessWhale. This is an array with one element for each phrase that the user has chosen. (Setting a Banned Phrase hides all items that contain a matching phrase from the user's view. API calls such as `feed` apply the banned phrases masking automatically, but you can fetch the phrases themselves with this call so that clients can allow users to edit them.)
