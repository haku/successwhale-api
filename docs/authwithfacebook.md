Authenticate with Facebook
--------------------------

SuccessWhale API function to authenticate a user using with Facebook.

Comes in two GET forms - one, when `callback_url` provided, which
returns the URL to visit to authorise the app. This will include the 
`callback_url` within it, so that once authenticated, the user will be
redirected back to that URL.

This callback will be a GET containing a parameter called `code` which
the client must pass back to this API endpoint in order to finish the
authentication and add the Facebook account to the current user's set
(if `token` is provided), or create a new SW user for that Facebook
account (if `token` isn't provided). To do this, use the
second form of this endpoint, where `code` is provided. To verify that
it's the same client communicating, it must provide the same value
of `callback_url` to this call too.
