Get Columns
-----------

Returns the list of columns (`columns`) that the current user has set up in SuccessWhale. This is an array with one element for each column. Each element itself consists of a sub-array (`feeds`) of one or more feeds that is pulled into that column, a complete 'feed path' that should be provided to the GET feed API in order to retrieve data for that colument (`feedpath`), and a 'friendly' autogenerated title (`title`) that clients can use for display. Each feed in the `feeds` array is a hash which contains four items: the service the feed comes from (`service`) e.g. Twitter, the user ID to access that service as (`uid`), the username for the client to display when referring to that user ID (`username`), the URL of the feed relative to the base URL of the service (`url`) e.g. "statuses/home_timeline".
